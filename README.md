## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. Insert 5 LEDs into the breadboard.  
2. Connect a **220Œ© resistor** from each ESP32 GPIO pin to the **anode (+)** leg of the LED.  
3. Connect all LED **cathodes (‚Äì)** together to the **GND rail** on the breadboard.  
4. Connect the breadboard **GND rail** to an ESP32 **GND pin**.  
5. Open the `PWM_5LEDs.ino` sketch in Arduino IDE.  
6. Select your ESP32 board and COM port.  
7. Upload the sketch.  
8. Watch the LEDs fade smoothly with PWM control.
